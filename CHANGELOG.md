# Change Log

## [1.38.0] - 2026-08-20

### Security
* Prevent Git argument injection from the webview: commit hashes, branch/tag/remote names and stash selectors received from the Git Graph View are validated before being passed to Git, so values like `--upload-pack=...` or `--exec=...` can no longer be smuggled into Git commands (`fetch`, `push`, `checkout`, `reset`, `revert`, `cherry-pick`, `drop`, `addTag`, `addRemote`, stash operations, and the Gerrit actions).
* Fix a command injection in the interactive rebase opened in the integrated terminal: the branch name is now safely POSIX-quoted (a branch name containing quotes or shell metacharacters previously broke out of the command).
* Fix an XSS in the Find widget: commit messages and author names containing HTML (e.g. `<img onerror=...>`) are no longer interpreted as HTML when highlighted as find matches.
* Escape custom emoji mapping payloads as HTML and cap their length, so a malicious mapping can no longer inject markup into commit messages.
* Remove the hardcoded GitLab API token from the source code: the GitLab avatar lookup now runs unauthenticated by default, and an optional `review-graph.avatars.gitlabToken` setting (read-only scope is sufficient) can be configured to raise the API rate limit.
* Encode the JSON payloads embedded in the webview's inline `<script>` elements, so repository names or paths containing `</script>` can no longer break out of the script block.
* Harden the askpass server: malformed or unauthenticated requests now receive an HTTP 400 response instead of crashing the request handler, and the askpass shell scripts quote their variables.

### Stability
* Errors thrown while handling a webview message are now caught and logged, and the repository file watcher is always unmuted afterwards (a failing action previously left the watcher muted forever, silently stopping repository refreshes).
* The file watcher mute state is reference counted, so concurrent Git actions can no longer re-enable the watcher while another action is still running (spurious refresh loops).
* Guarded the avatar manager against malformed API responses and unexpected content types (previously crashed the extension host), and URL-encode the email in the GitLab API request.
* Remote Gerrit operations (`ls-remote` / `fetch`) now time out after 60 seconds, so a stalled SSH/HTTP connection can no longer block the view in a loading state forever; the parsed NoteDb meta cache is capped at 500 entries (LRU).
* Guarded the webview against crashes on stale commits: requesting details, context menus or the commit details view for a commit that is no longer loaded no longer throws; handler errors in the webview message loop are isolated per message.
* Fixed Gerrit meta event rows being anchored to the wrong commit when several commits share one change number (multiple patchsets).
* Fixed `getAuthorList` returning an object instead of an array on error, `evalPromises` hanging when the parallelism is zero, `stopWatchingFolder` failing on unwatched folders, the buffered queue dropping falsy items, and the commit history search (`searchCommits`) misparsing subjects and author names containing `|`.

### Responsiveness
* The graph column width limit is recomputed when the view is resized (previously kept a stale width until the next commit reload).
* The Find widget, the repository settings widget and the dropdown menus now adapt to narrow and short views (no more overflowing past the left edge or past the bottom of the window).
* The Gerrit control row drops its dead right-hand padding, and all controls wrap gracefully on narrow views.
* The Gerrit review colours now follow the active theme (VS Code chart colours) and support the high-contrast theme.

### Added
* **Filter commits by path**: a new filter button (next to Find) limits the loaded commits to those that modified a file or directory (git pathspec syntax supported), addressing the most requested upstream feature.
* **Compare commits**: "Select for Compare" / "Compare with Selected Commit" in the commit context menu open the diff between any two commits.
* **Diff with Working Tree**: the commit context menu can open an external directory diff between a commit and the current working tree.
* Branding: all user-facing messages now consistently say "Review Graph".

### Tests
* Restored the 40 skipped `DataSource` tests (repository info, commit loading and config), updated to the current command pipeline (NUL-separated log records, full-body subjects, Gerrit change-ref exclusions, tags).
* Added a real-Git scenario suite (`tests/complexGitScenarios.test.ts`): non-fast-forward merges, octopus merges, rebased history, orphan branches, annotated/lightweight/multiple tags, stashes, detached HEAD, empty repositories, the new path filter, and separator characters in subjects/author names.
* Added the first unit tests of the webview modules (`web/graph.ts` colour stability/lane layout, `web/textFormatter.ts` escaping/formatting/XSS regressions), a security regression suite (input validation, injection rejection, shell quoting, inline-script encoding), error-isolation tests for the webview message dispatcher, and GitLab token/malformed-response tests for the avatar manager.

## [1.37.32] - 2026-08-20
* Add a "Gerrit Code Review > Change Refs Cache" setting to the Git Graph View's Repository Settings: choose between caching **all** open Gerrit change refs (`refs/remotes/<remote>/changes/*`) or only the **latest N changes** (1..10000). The choice is saved to the global User Settings (`review-graph.gerrit.fetchMode` / `review-graph.gerrit.fetchLimit`), the Gerrit cache is invalidated immediately, and the view reloads and re-fetches (pruning surplus local change refs) so the new cache size takes effect right away.

## [1.37.31] - 2026-08-19
* Make every event row of the Gerrit review dialog expandable: clicking an event shows the full verbatim NoteDb record of that event (patchset, commit hash, labels, status and submit footers) in a monospace block below the row, with a rotating chevron indicating the toggle. Events persisted by older versions (without the full record) render as before and are not clickable.
* Add an "Amend Change-Id" action to the Gerrit controls row: generates a Gerrit-shaped Change-Id and amends it onto HEAD in one click (only when HEAD has no Change-Id yet and hasn't been pushed to any remote; reports the existing Change-Id otherwise). The Submit-for-Review flow now shares the same safety checks.

## [1.37.30] - 2026-08-19
* Fix the commit graph changing when the "Merged" status chip is toggled: merged changes' patchset refs are no longer injected into the commit log, because their content is already part of the target branch's history (submitted, possibly re-hashed by a cherry-pick/rebase submit strategy). Previously these (often dangling) patchset commits appeared as extra floating chains at the top of the graph and pushed real branch commits out of the loaded commits window. Toggling the chip now only affects the review info (badges/labels) shown on commits, never the commits in the graph.
* Increase the default of the `review-graph.gerrit.fetchLimit` setting from 10 to 20, so the 20 most recent Gerrit change refs are fetched and displayed in 'latest' fetch mode (users who set the setting explicitly are unaffected).
* Add a real-Git integration test suite (`tests/gerritIntegration.test.ts`) that builds simulated Gerrit repositories in a temp directory (bare "server" with `refs/changes/*` + NoteDb meta refs; merge-submit, cherry-pick-submit, open/abandoned/WIP changes, no-Gerrit and empty repositories) and verifies the full pipeline: ls-remote discovery, targeted fetch, meta parsing, status-filtered ref injection, the graph-stability guarantee of the fix above, the loaded-commits window, meta-commit leak prevention, pruning and clearing of local change refs.
* Add a full Gerrit status-filter × configuration matrix to the GitGraphView tests (chip combinations, `includeChangeCommits`, `patchsets: all`, integration disabled, `fetchMode: off`, configured default filter, fetch failure degradation and cache fallback) and extend the Gerrit unit tests with NoteDb edge cases (pushed/cherry-picked submit strategies, restored/WIP/ready transitions, vote magnitude, patchset header precedence, head-hash fallback, hex-only commit footers).

## [1.37.29] - 2026-08-19
* Replace the Gerrit meta event chip's box-drawing text (`├─┼─ +2/+1`) with a single compact chevron toggle button: no more tab-drawing characters or review score numbers next to the change badge (scores remain visible on the CR/V labels and in the expanded event rows).

## [1.37.28] - 2026-08-19
* Rename the extension's entire Visual Studio Code namespace from `git-graph` to `review-graph` (command IDs, configuration setting keys, diff view URI scheme, webview type, context keys, and the per-repository config file, now `.vscode/review-graph.json`), so Review Graph and the original Git Graph extension can be installed and used side by side without conflicts. Both extensions' SCM title-bar buttons now appear together, each with its own icon.
* Note: settings previously configured for this extension under `git-graph.*` must be re-applied under `review-graph.*`, and per-repository config files must be renamed from `.vscode/vscode-git-graph.json` to `.vscode/review-graph.json`.
* Fix the "View Review Graph" SCM button and Diff Views breaking when the original Git Graph extension is installed at the same time (caused by duplicate `git-graph.*` command IDs and URI scheme).
* Repair the GitGraphView test suite (dead since the Gerrit integration commit) and align all tests with the Review Graph behaviour and naming.

## [1.37.27] - 2026-08-19
* Always show the review actor in Gerrit meta event rows: the reviewer column no longer collapses to zero width when space is tight (it truncates with an ellipsis at a 4em floor instead), and the date column floor is right-sized (8.5em) to save space.
* Show the change owner (author of the "Create change" event) in the Gerrit change dialog header.

## [1.37.26] - 2026-08-19
* Align the time and reviewer columns of Gerrit review event meta rows (both in the commit table and the change dialog timeline): event text fills the left and ellipsizes when long, reviewer names are right-aligned, and dates get a fixed-width right-aligned column with tabular numerals.

## [1.37.25] - 2026-08-19
* Redesign extension icon and Gerrit command/webview icons: combine the Git Graph branch visualization with a Gerrit review badge (orange, white ring and checkmark) on the tip commit; dark/light theme icon variants keep the badge monochrome to match their grayscale palettes.
* Fix white ring of the Gerrit badge in SVG icons not rendering due to CSS presentation-attribute precedence.

## [1.37.15] - 2026-06-21
* Fix extension activation failure caused by duplicated command registrations, ensuring Diff Views function correctly.

## [1.37.14] - 2026-06-20
* Fix URI parsing for diff views to handle URL-encoded components gracefully, resolving issues viewing file changes.

## [1.37.13] - 2026-06-20
* Add "Search Commits in History..." command to allow searching through the entire repository history by message, author, or hash (issues #22).

## [1.37.12] - 2026-06-20
* Consolidate upstream context menu enhancements: "Edit Message", "Reset Last Commit (Soft)", "Create Branch", and "Pull Branch".
* Fix commit/stash/tag message input fields to use textareas, preserving newlines in multi-line messages.
* Fix tag auto-increment bug to correctly ignore remote prefixes.
* Default "Push to remote" option in Add Tag dialog to the repository's default remote.

## [1.37.11] - 2026-06-19
* Format changelog headers to comply with VS Code extension marketplace requirements for proper parsing.

## [1.37.10]
* Ignore missing remote tag errors when deleting a remote tag to cleanly fallback to local cleanup.

## [1.37.9]
* Apply gitRefHeadRemote styling to remote tags to match remote branches visually.

## [1.37.8]
* Fix inline body rendering issue caused by carriage return parsing across different OS environments.

## [1.37.7]
* Set `showBodyInline` to false by default and ensure full title rendering without ellipsis when enabled.

## [1.37.6]
* Visually combine local and remote tags into a single label.

## [1.37.5]
* Track remote tags properly locally by auto adding refspec.

## [1.37.4]
* Implement tag auto-increment and external diff tool custom args (issues #20, #15).
* Parse remote tags explicitly to display origin in tag name (issue #24).

## [1.37.1]
* Ensure all branch fixes are successfully merged and tracked.

## [1.37.0]
* Consolidate multiple issue fixes (issues 7, 12, 16, 19, 30, 33).
* Update git log formatting to support complex commit messages safely.
* Fix avatar and diff extension logic.

## [1.36.2]

## [1.36.1]
* Add 'Compare with...' context menu action for branches.
* Add configurable font size and row height for the commit table.
* Add `git-graph.repository.commits.showCommitBodyInline` setting to optionally hide commit body in graph (defaults to true).
* Fix subject extraction to split on the first line break.
* Update dependencies.

## [1.35.0]
* Update README to explicitly state that this extension is a distinct fork of the original Git Graph.
* Clarify distinguishing features and additional value provided by this fork.
* Update branding and description to differentiate from the original extension.

## [1.34.0]

* [mhutchie#494](https://github.com/mhutchie/vscode-git-graph/issues/494) Logging Enhancements: transform empty args, and logging command invocations.

## 1.30.0 - 2021-04-05
* #395 Added a "Force Fetch" option onto the "Fetch into Local Branch" Dialog, allowing any local branch (that's not checked out) to be reset to the remote branch. This dialog is accessed via the Remote Branch Context Menu.
* #457 New "View Diff with Working File" action on the File Context Menu in the Commit Details View.
* #466 New "Copy Relative File Path to Clipboard" action on the File Context Menu in the Commit Details View.
* #471 Spaces can be automatically substituted with hyphens or underscores in reference inputs on dialogs (e.g. Create Branch, Add Tag, etc.), by configuring the new extension setting `git-graph.dialog.general.referenceInputSpaceSubstitution`.
* #476 "Open File" action is now available in the Visual Studio Code Diff View Title Menu, when the Diff View is opened from the Git Graph View. (Requires Visual Studio Code >= 1.42.0)
* #479 New Repository Dropdown Order option "Workspace Full Path", that sorts repositories according to the Visual Studio Code Workspace Folder order, then alphabetically by the full path of the repository. This is the new default order for the `git-graph.repositoryDropdownOrder` extension setting.
* #480 When loading the Working File for a file from a historical commit, and the file has since been renamed, Git is now used to detect renames and enable the Working File to be opened. For example: from the "Open File" & "View Diff with Working File" actions on the File Context Menu in the Commit Details View.
* #482 New "Mark as Reviewed" & "Mark as Not Reviewed" actions on the File Context Menu in the Commit Details View, when a Code Review is in progress. Thanks [Dan Arad (@dan1994)](https://github.com/dan1994) for implementing this!
* #486 All Git Graph View Keyboard Shortcut extension settings can now alternatively be set to "UNASSIGNED", if you don't want to have a keybinding for a specific Keyboard Shortcut.
* #491 Standardise the cross-platform rendering of Markdown inline code blocks, to ensure they don't affect the height of each commit.
* Various code improvements.

## 1.29.0 - 2021-02-28
* #390 When creating a branch or adding a tag, the name is now checked against all existing branches and tags in the repository. If a branch / tag already exists with the same name, a new dialog is displayed that allows you to: replace the existing branch / tag, or to choose another name.
* #402 New mode for the Find Widget, which will additionally open the Commit Details View as you navigate through each of the matched commits. This mode is enabled / disabled via a new button on the Find Widget.
* #404 New context menu on all link elements (e.g. Issue Links, URL's in commit messages, author email addresses), enabling the URL to be copied to the clipboard.
* #417 New context menu actions for branches, to select / unselect the branch in the Branches Dropdown.
* #424 Consume Git configuration variables (`remote.pushDefault`, `branch.<name>.remote` & `branch.<name>.pushRemote`) to set the default remote to push branches and tags to (when multiple remotes are configured for a repository).
* #426 If a diff tool is configured in Git (`diff.tool` or `diff.guitool`), you can now open a directory diff in the configured tool from the Commit Details View Control Bar. Note: `diff.tool` is opened via a Visual Studio Code Terminal, whereas `diff.guitool` is opened via a background process.
* #427 When deleting a branch that is not fully merged, and "Force Delete" is not set on the "Delete Branch" dialog, a new dialog is subsequently shown to allow one-click force deletion, instead of displaying the error message returned by Git.
* #429 Stashes can be hidden on the Git Graph View by disabling the new extension setting `git-graph.repository.showStashes`. It can be overridden per repository in the Git Graph View's Repository Settings Widget.
* #452 Explicitly override the Git configuration variable `log.showSignature` to ensure consistent parsing of commits.
* Significant code and UI improvements.

## 1.28.0 - 2020-12-01
* #399 Sign Commits and Tags created by actions in the Git Graph View, by enabling the new extension settings `git-graph.repository.sign.commits` and `git-graph.repository.sign.tags` respectively. This is an alternative to the existing method using Git config (`commit.gpgSign` and `tag.gpgSign`).
* #406 The keybindings for all Git Graph View keyboard shortcuts can now be configured using new extension settings `git-graph.keyboardShortcut.*`.
* #407 Control whether Remote Head Symbolic References (e.g. origin/HEAD) are displayed in Git Graph via the new extension setting `git-graph.repository.showRemoteHeads`. Thanks [Maciej Wilk (@wilkmaciej)](https://github.com/wilkmaciej) for helping with this!
* #409 Include built-in support for new emoji shortcodes recently added to [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/).
* #412 New "Git Graph: Fetch from Remote(s)" command contributed to Visual Studio Code, that opens the Git Graph View and immediately runs "Fetch from Remote(s)".
* #414 Your Git Graph Repository Configuration can now be exported to a file that can be committed in the repository. It allows others working in the same repository to automatically use the same Git Graph configuration. To export your configuration, click the "Export Repository Configuration" button at the bottom of the Repository Settings Widget (on the Git Graph View).
* #416 The existing file encoding extension setting `git-graph.fileEncoding` can now also be configured at a Workspace Folder Scope.
* #419 On dialogs that refer to the "current branch" (Merge, Pull, Rebase, and Reset), the current branch is now explicitly mentioned.
* #420 Fixed an issue that prevented files that overflow horizontally in the Commit Details View Files View from being left-clicked (i.e. those shortened with an ellipsis). _(issue introduced via #381)_
* Significant code improvements.

## 1.27.0 - 2020-11-01
* #281 For the Repository Settings Widget, read values defined in additional Git config files when they're included via [include directives](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_includes) in local or global Git config files.
* #364 Parse and render a frequently used subset of inline Markdown formatting rules in commit messages and tag details (bold, italics, bold & italics, and inline code blocks). Markdown parsing can be disabled using the extension setting `git-graph.markdown`.
* #381 New Commit Details View File Context Menu, which is an alternative method to run any available actions on a file ("View Diff", "View File at this Revision", "Open File", and "Copy File Path to the Clipboard").
* #383 When the Commit Details View is open, the `CTRL/CMD + Up` / `CTRL/CMD + Down` keystrokes may be used to navigate topologically to the child / parent on the same branch (the existing behaviour). Now there is a new Shift Key Modifier, that when pressed in combination with the existing keystrokes (i.e. `CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + Up` / `CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + Down`), will follow the alternative branch when a branch or a merge is encountered.
* #385 Push branches or tags to multiple remotes from their respective dialogs.
* #386 Detect commit hashes in the body of the commit that's displayed in the Commit Details View, and make them clickable links that open the Commit Details View for the referenced commit.
* #389 Use the Visual Studio Code Color Theme's text selection background colour (set by some themes and users) in the Git Graph View.
* #392 Support Visual Studio Code's `git.path` Setting containing an array of possible Git executable paths (introduced in Visual Studio Code 1.50.0).
* #393 New display option for the Uncommitted Changes in the graph. This is controlled by the new extension setting `git-graph.graph.uncommittedChanges`.
    * Open Circle at the Uncommitted Changes: Display the Uncommitted Changes as a grey open circle, connected to the commit referenced by HEAD with a solid grey line. The current file system's state is therefore always displayed as an open circle in the graph. *(the existing behaviour)*
    * Open Circle at the Checked Out Commit: Display the Uncommitted Changes as a grey closed circle, connected to the commit referenced by HEAD with a dotted grey line. The commit referenced by HEAD is therefore always displayed as an open circle in the graph. *(the new option)*
* #398 New command "Git Graph: Get Version Information", that displays basic version information of the Git Graph installation, and allows it to be easily copied to the clipboard.
* Various code improvements.

## 1.26.0 - 2020-09-13
* #318 Customise the branches that are initially shown when the Git Graph View is first opened. Each repository can have it's initial branches configured from the Repository Settings Widget on the Git Graph View, or they may inherit the global configuration set by the extension settings `git-graph.repository.onLoad.showCheckedOutBranch` & `git-graph.repository.onLoad.showSpecificBranches`.
* #341 Added a new extension setting `git-graph.repository.showRemoteBranches`, to set the default value of the "Show Remote Branches" repository setting.
* #356 More control over pruning when fetching:
    * Added a new extension setting `git-graph.repository.fetchAndPruneTags`, to enable pruning tags when fetching from remote(s) using the Fetch button on the Git Graph View Control Bar. Default: false (disabled)
    * When fetching a specific remote via the Repository Settings Widget, a "Fetch Remote" dialog is now shown. This dialog provides new options for pruning remote-tracking references and tags. The default value of these options can be set using the new extension settings `git-graph.dialog.fetchRemote.prune` & `git-graph.dialog.fetchRemote.pruneTags`.
* #357 Set a custom name for a repository via the Repository Settings Widget. If set, this custom name helps to differentiate repositories with the same name on the File System.
* #359 When the Git Graph View initially loads, Up / Down keys can now be used scroll the view.
* #361 Many extension settings have been renamed to leverage Visual Studio Code's setting grouping, to make Git Graph settings easier to find / discover. If you previously used any of the renamed settings, the value you previously set will still be used until you set the equivalent new setting.
* #363 Improved support for High Contrast Visual Studio Code Color Theme's.
* #365 Improved the topological check to determine whether the "Drop..." action is available for a commit (when viewing the Commit Context Menu).
* #369 When fetching commit author avatars from Gravatar, fetch email addresses case-insensitive.
* #372 Improved handling of repositories on Mapped Network Drives on Windows with Git >= 2.25.0.
* #376 When loading the Repository Settings Widget, no longer require a global .gitconfig file to exist.
* Significant code and UI improvements.

## 1.25.0 - 2020-07-26
* #293 Added an "Open a Terminal for this Repository" button onto the Git Graph View Control Bar.
* #321 Added a new extension setting `git-graph.repositoryDropdownOrder`, to set the order that repositories are sorted in the repository dropdown on the Git Graph View (only visible when more than one repository exists in the current Visual Studio Code Workspace). Default: Full Path
* #322 Added the "Merge into current branch..." action onto the remote branch context menu.
* #327 Added a new extension setting `git-graph.dialog.cherryPick.noCommit`, to set the default value of the "No Commit" option on the Cherry Pick Dialog.
* #331 Added two extension settings to specify the message format of the squash commit optionally created via the Merge & Pull Branch Dialogs respectively. The supported formats are: the existing squash message generated by Git Graph, and the detailed squash message generated by Git (stored in .git/SQUASH_MSG). 
* #336 Added new extension settings to set the default options on the Pull Branch Dialog.
* #337 Enhanced the Commit Details View File Tree renderer to better display deeply nested directory structures, such that folders with a single child folder are compressed into a single combined folder element. This behaviour can be disabled by using the new extension setting `git-graph.commitDetailsView.fileView.fileTree.compactFolders`.
* Significant code and UI improvements.

## 1.24.0 - 2020-06-14
* #271 Support for Visual Studio Code in Web Browsers. Git Graph officially supports Visual Studio Code in Microsoft's Visual Studio Codespaces in the Google Chrome browser, however the underlying changes allow Git Graph to be supported in most third-party Visual Studio Code browser-based platforms, and in most popular web browsers.
* #297 When checking out a remote branch & the specified branch name already exists locally, the dialog option to "Checkout the existing branch" has been replaced with "Checkout the existing branch & pull changes".
* #304 Override the globally configured commit ordering (configured by `git-graph.repository.commits.order`) per repository from the Git Graph View Column Header context menu.
* #305 Upgraded the minimum version requirement of Visual Studio Code from 1.31.0 to 1.38.0. This change has been needed for some time, however I now have to make this change due to Visual Studio Code decreasing support for older Webview integrations for all extensions. Almost all users of Git Graph will be unaffected by this change. If you are one of the few Git Graph users who use a version of Visual Studio Code older than 1.38.0, please upgrade Visual Studio Code to continue receiving updates to Git Graph. 
* #316 Include built-in support for several new emoji shortcodes recently added to [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/).
* #319 Added a new extension setting `git-graph.enhancedAccessibility`, that enables visual file change A|M|D|R|U indicators in the Commit Details View for users with colour blindness. In the future, this setting will enable any additional accessibility related features of Git Graph that aren't enabled by default. Default: false (disabled)
* Various code improvements.

## 1.23.0 - 2020-05-24
* #89 Added a new "Include commits only mentioned by reflogs" option to the Git Graph View's Repository Settings Widget. The default value can be defined globally for all repositories using the new extension setting `git-graph.repository.includeCommitsMentionedByReflogs`. Default: false (disabled)
* #201 New Keyboard Shortcuts in the Git Graph View for scrolling to stashes:
    * `CTRL/CMD + S`: Scrolls the Git Graph View to the first (or next) stash in the loaded commits.
    * `CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + S`: Scrolls the Git Graph View to the last (or previous) stash in the loaded commits.
* #277 Open the Visual Studio Code Diff View from the Git Graph View in a specific Editor Group. Previously `git-graph.openNewTabEditorGroup` only supported `Active` & `Beside`, now it additionally supports `One`, `Two`, `Three`, ... , `Nine`.
* #279 Support Chinese / Japanese / Korean IME Keyboard Enter Events on Mac's for dialog submission. Thanks [Kazuma Ebina (@kazuma1989)](https://github.com/kazuma1989)!
* #283 After the Keyboard Shortcut `CTRL + H` is run in the Git Graph View to scroll to the HEAD commit, the commit now momentarily flashes to draw attention to it.
* #285 Added a new extension setting `git-graph.repository.showUntrackedFiles`, that controls whether untracked files are included in the uncommitted changes on the Git Graph View. Default: true (enabled)
* #286 Added a "View File at this Revision" button for each file displayed in the Commit Details / Comparison Views.
* #287 Added a new "Only follow the first parent of commits" option to the Git Graph View's Repository Settings Widget. The default value can be defined globally for all repositories using the new extension setting `git-graph.repository.onlyFollowFirstParent`. Default: false (disabled)
